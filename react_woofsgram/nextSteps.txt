Next Steps
Continue on your Expo and React Native journey with these suggestions

Well done so far! At this point you can build React Native and Expo apps with core components, custom components, styling, and navigation. You can use Flexbox properties, explain density-independent pixels, and tell the difference between stack, drawer, and tab navigation patterns.

Now that you’ve mastered the basics, it’s time to leave the Codecademy nest. There are lots of packages, libraries, tools, and communities in the React Native and Expo world to explore.

Build a few basic apps on your own to verify your learning, then, when you’re ready for more, try your hand at these topics:

Animation with libraries such as Reanimated or Moti
Working with external APIs
Deploying your app to app stores
And here are some useful resources to bookmark:

Expo documentation
Expo forums
Expo Discord
React Native documentation
r/reactnative on Reddit
Popular React Native YouTube channels here and here
